# Shipinator Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration

1. ~~**Define the `.shipinator.yaml` schema as Go types** — Create a `config` package with structs for `BuildConfig`, `TestConfig`, `DeployConfig`, and their nested step/output types. Write a `Load()` function that parses YAML into these structs. Write tests with sample YAML files.~~ ✅

2. ~~**Set up server configuration** — Implement server-level config (listen address, DB connection string, artifact store path, k8s config). Use viper with YAML files and `SHIPINATOR_*` env var overrides. Nested `DBConfig` struct with individual fields (host, port, user, password, name, ssl_mode). Wired into `cmd/server/main.go`.~~ ✅

3. ~~**Choose and add dependencies** — Using `pgx` (via golibs/postgres), golibs migration runner, Echo v4 HTTP router, and `google/uuid`. All in `go.mod`/`go.sum`.~~ ✅

## Phase 2: Database & Data Model

4. ~~**Write SQL migrations** — Full relational schema from the DMD: `projects`, `repositories`, `pipelines`, `pipeline_runs`, `jobs`, `job_steps`, `artifacts`, `executions`. 8 migration files in `migrations/` with FK indexes, TIMESTAMPTZ, gen_random_uuid() PKs. Migration runner wired into server startup.~~ ✅

5. **Implement repository layer** — Create a `store` or `db` package with Go interfaces and Postgres implementations for CRUD on each table. Start with `ProjectStore`, `RepositoryStore`, `PipelineStore`, etc. Write tests against a real or test database.

6. **Implement the Artifact metadata store** — The `artifacts` table operations: create, get-by-id, list-by-job. This is metadata only — the actual bytes come later.

## Phase 3: Domain Core — State Machines

7. **Implement the Stage FSM** — Create an `fsm` or `orchestrator` package. Model the stage states: `PENDING -> RUNNING -> SUCCEEDED | FAILED`. Enforce valid transitions. Write thorough tests for every valid and invalid transition.

8. **Implement the Job/Pipeline Run FSM** — Model the pipeline run states: `PENDING -> RUNNING -> SUCCESS | FAILED | CANCELED`. Model how stage outcomes drive pipeline run transitions (e.g., stage FAILED -> pipeline run FAILED). Persist transitions via the store layer.

9. **Implement the Orchestrator** — This is the core coordinator. Given a pipeline run, it should: determine which stages to execute, advance the FSM through `BUILDING -> BUILT -> TESTING -> TESTED -> DEPLOYING -> DEPLOYED`, and react to stage completion callbacks. This drives everything but executes nothing.

## Phase 4: Executor Abstraction

10. **Define the Executor interface** — Implement `ExecutionSpec`, `ExecutionHandle`, `ExecutionStatus` types and the `Executor` interface (`Submit`, `Status`, `Cancel`) in an `executor` package.

11. **Implement a mock/local executor** — Before touching Kubernetes, build a simple executor (runs a local command or just logs and returns success) so you can test the full orchestration loop end-to-end without a cluster.

12. **Implement the Kubernetes executor** — Translate `ExecutionSpec` into a K8s `Job` resource. Handle submission, status polling/watching, and cancellation. Keep all K8s imports and logic contained in this one implementation.

## Phase 5: Artifact Storage

13. **Define the ArtifactStore interface** — `Put(ctx, artifact) (ref, error)` and `Get(ctx, ref) (io.ReadCloser, error)` in an `artifact` package.

14. **Implement the NFS-backed ArtifactStore** — Use the flat `/<artifact-id>/payload` + `metadata.json` layout from the DMD. Write to a configurable base path. Write tests.

## Phase 6: Subsystem Implementations (Buildinator, Testinator, Deployinator)

15. **Implement Buildinator** — Translate build steps from `.shipinator.yaml` into `ExecutionSpec`s. Submit them to the Executor. On completion, register produced artifacts in the store. Handle Go binary, OCI image, and Helm chart build outputs.

16. **Implement Testinator** — Translate test steps into `ExecutionSpec`s. Support sequential and parallel step groups (use `parallel_group` from the schema). Collect test result artifacts (coverage reports, etc.).

17. **Implement Deployinator** — Accept artifact references (never source). Translate deploy config into `ExecutionSpec`s that run `helm install` or `kubectl apply` inside the executor. Target a local K8s cluster for v1.

## Phase 7: API Layer

18. **Define the protobuf API** — Flesh out `api/v1/shipinator.proto` with messages and services for pipeline control, artifact access, and executor callbacks. Generate Go code.

19. **Implement API handlers** — Wire up the HTTP/gRPC endpoints from the DMD:
    - `POST /v1/pipelines/{id}/runs` — trigger a pipeline run
    - `GET /v1/pipeline-runs/{id}` — get run status
    - `GET /v1/pipeline-runs/{id}/jobs` — list jobs in a run
    - `GET /v1/artifacts/{id}/metadata` and `/download`
    - `POST /v1/executions/{id}/status` — executor callback

20. **Wire everything together in `cmd/server/main.go`** — Initialize DB, create stores, create executor, create orchestrator, create subsystems, start HTTP server. This is where the modular monolith comes together.

## Phase 8: Server Lifecycle & Reliability

21. **Implement graceful shutdown** — Handle `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, drain in-flight requests, and cleanly close DB connections.

22. **Implement crash recovery** — On startup, query for pipeline runs stuck in `RUNNING` state. Re-check executor status and resume or fail them. This is the idempotency guarantee from the TDD.

23. **Add structured logging** — Use `slog` or similar. Attach `job_id`, `pipeline_run_id`, `stage_type` to log entries. Link logs via `logs_ref`.

## Phase 9: Builder Docker Image

24. **Flesh out `builders/builder.Dockerfile`** — Build an executor worker image containing Go toolchain, Docker (or buildah/kaniko for OCI builds), Helm, and kubectl. This is what K8s Jobs will run.

## Phase 10: CLI & Web UI

25. **Build the CLI** — A `shipinator` command (or separate binary) that talks to the API. Core commands: `trigger`, `status`, `logs`, `list`. Use `cobra` or similar.

26. **Build a minimal web UI** — Show pipeline runs, job status, logs. Keep it simple — server-rendered HTML with Go templates, or a lightweight SPA. This is last because the API must be stable first.

## Phase 11: Dogfooding

27. **Write Shipinator's own `.shipinator.yaml`** — Define build (Go binary + OCI image), test (`go test`), and deploy (to your local cluster) for Shipinator itself.

28. **Deploy Shipinator using Shipinator** — The final milestone. Trigger a pipeline run that builds, tests, and deploys the Shipinator server to your cluster.
